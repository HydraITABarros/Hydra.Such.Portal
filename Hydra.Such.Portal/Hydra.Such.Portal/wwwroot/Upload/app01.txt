This service logs unique client access requests, in the form of IP addresses and user names, of installed products and roles on the local server.

If the service is disabled, client requests will not be logged and will not be retrievable via Powershell queries. Stopping the service will not affect query of historical data (see supporting documentation for steps to delete historical data). The local system administrator must consult his, or her, Windows Server license terms to determine the number of CALs that are required for the server software to be appropriately licensed; use of the UAL service and data does not alter this obligation.

Windows Remote Management (WinRM) service implements the WS-Management protocol for remote management. WS-Management is a standard web services protocol used for remote software and hardware management. The WinRM service listens on the network for WS-Management requests and processes them. The WinRM Service needs to be configured with a listener using winrm.cmd command line tool or through Group Policy in order for it to listen over the network. The WinRM service provides access to WMI data and enables event collection. Event collection and subscription to events require that the service is running. WinRM messages use HTTP and HTTPS as transports. The WinRM service does not depend on IIS but is preconfigured to share a port with IIS on the same machine.  The WinRM service reserves the /wsman URL prefix. To prevent conflicts with IIS, administrators should ensure that any websites hosted on IIS do not use the /wsman URL prefix.
